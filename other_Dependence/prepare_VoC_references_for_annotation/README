Prepare barcode references for each SARS-CoV-2 vanriants of concerns (VoCs)

## Dominant mutations (\nt) for all VoCs from: https://cov-spectrum.org/;
Example files under nt\
! These files need to be created for any interested VoC before running any steps.

## hierachical structure (e.g., parent VoC) for all VoCs from: https://cov-spectrum.org/;
Example file: family_tree_barcode_of_interest_delta_omicron_github.xlsx <br>
! This file needs to bcreated before running any steps. Any interested VoCs need to be included;

## Create covspectrum_variant_of_interest_hierachical_10182023@0.9_v2.mat using function prepare_barcode_covspectrum_v2.m 
Example to run this function is given under script_example_code_create_barcode_mat_file.m
To test our code, this file is provided. It needs to be generated if you are interested in a different set of VoCs.
