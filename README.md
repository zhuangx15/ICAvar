# ICAvar
Early Detection of Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variants from Urban and Rural Wastewater through Genome Sequencing and Machine Learning

Software and Packages required: 
1. Matlab: https://www.mathworks.com/
2. ICAsso*: https://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/icasso/
3. FastICA: https://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/
 *Under other_Dependence folder we have provided icasso122 and FastICA_25 packages for the purpose of testing the code. You MUST obtain proper usage permissions from the orignial authors. 

Steps:
1. running ICA
2. dual regression
3. annotate dual-regressed signal to known COVID strains
4. identify potential novel mutations

Testing dataset:
